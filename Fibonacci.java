/** ************************************************************
 * Purpose/Description: This program uses a O(log n) algorithm to 
 * preform calculations to return the nth Fibonacci number. 
 * 
 * Part B - This program's running time complexity is O(log n).
 * The program is based on the notion that a Fibonnacci sequence can be
 * represented by the following formula: 
 * 
 * fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n>= 3
 * 
 * which can be represented by the matrix:
 * 
 * [1 1]^n   [F(n+1) F(n)  ] 
 * [1 0]   = [F(n)   F(n-1)]
 * 
 * 
 * With with formula can use exponential squaring to calculate the power of the
 * matrix by using the modulus values (even or odd) instead of using the large
 * exponent. This cuts the problem in half producing a O(log n) running time.
