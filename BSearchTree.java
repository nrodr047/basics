 Purpose/Description: This program manipulates a binary tree through the 
 * use of nodes, empty assumed methods, and methods assigned from the homework
 * that I have constructed. 
 * 
 * PART E: The statement that any element a in A, b in B, or c in C 
 * abides by a <= b <= c is false. Take for example this binary tree:
 *          60
 *        /    \
 *      30     80
 *     /      /   \
 *    20     70    90
 *          /  \
 *         65   85
 * 
 *  Let A = {20, 30, 65}
 *  Let B = {60, 80, 70, 85}
 *  Let C = {90}
 * 
 * Suppose that leaf l is 85 in the path p {60, 80, 70, 85} in B.
 * Here we see that although A is on the left side of B, there is an element 
 * in A (65) that is greater than an element in B (60). Therefore the statement
 * that a <= b <= c is FALSE.
 * 
 *
